### The Mission of Project Mayhem

Project Mayhem was born out of a passion for simplifying platform engineering. My goal was to create an accessible, AI-powered Internal Developer Platform that any organization could adopt without the overhead of complex infrastructure. By leveraging a single-VM deployment and open-source principles, Project Mayhem empowers developers to focus on innovation rather than setup. The platformâ€™s AI-driven golden paths and Backstage-compatible developer portal aim to streamline workflows and make software development more inclusive.

The mission extends beyond technology. Project Mayhem is about building a community where developers and platform engineers collaborate, share templates, and drive continuous improvement. By open-sourcing the platform, I hope to inspire others to contribute to its evolution and make platform engineering accessible to all.
